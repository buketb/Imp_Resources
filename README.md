# Imp_Resources
#Matlab/Octave
An implication of a dynamic model for the resources. It is the implication of the Brander_and_Taylor Model (Brander and Taylor (1998)), which is also know as an Lotka-Volterra Model.


Lotka-Volterra model is a model of predator-prey
interactions.

The model was developed independently by Lotka (1925)
and Volterra (1926).

The model are a pair of 1rst-order nonlinear differential
equations.

The model is mostly used to describe the dynamics of
biological systems in which two spices interact. 

More generally, it could be used to explain any kind of
relation which are similar to the interaction of a prey and
predator.

Brander and Taylor (1998) presents a general equilibrium
model to explain the dynamics of renewable resources and
population.
The model is related the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey
model.
They models a feast and famine patern of cyclical
adjustment in population and resource stock in Easter
Island.
Brander and Taylor (1998) sets plausible parameter values
for Easter Island and other civilizations.
